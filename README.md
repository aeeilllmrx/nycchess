## Overview

This is a Next.js app that powers this [site](https://nycchess.vercel.app/).

Each section of the site has its own directory in `src/app/`. Auxiliary logic pieces live in `src/components/`. Styling is (very basic) Tailwind.

## Local dev

To run locally, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
